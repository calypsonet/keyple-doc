# 'Eclipse Keyple' project 
## Status & current works (18/06/19)
- **Week #22**:
  - Finished a wide refactoring of the SE Proxy layer to requests for multi-SE.
  - Two PC Java examples are fully ready for the PC/SC plugin:
    - KeypleGenericDemo_ObservableReaderNotification ( [https://github.com/calypsonet/keyple-java/blob/develop/keyple-example/pc/src/main/java/org/eclipse/keyple/examples/pc/KeypleGenericDemo_ObservableReaderNotification.java](https://github.com/calypsonet/keyple-java/blob/develop/keyple-examples/pc/src/main/java/org/eclipse/keyple/example/pc/KeypleGenericDemo_ObservableReaderNotification.java) ) ==> to observe the readers' configuration & SEs' status on a PC (notification of reader hot-plug/unplug, notification of SE insertion/removal).
    - KeypleGenericDemo_SeProtocolDetection ( [https://github.com/calypsonet/keyple-java/blob/develop/keyple-example/pc/src/main/java/org/eclipse/keyple/examples/pc/KeypleGenericDemo_SeProtocolDetection.java](https://github.com/calypsonet/keyple-java/blob/develop/keyple-examples/pc/src/main/java/org/eclipse/keyple/example/pc/KeypleGenericDemo_SeProtocolDetection.java) ) ==> to detect the kind of SE presented on a contactless reader.

- **Week #23**:
  - Update of the Calypso Secured Session (org.eclipse.keyple.calypso.transaction.PoSecureSession) in order to support the new multi-SE request feature.
    - The third PC Java example 'KeypleCalypsoDemo_HoplinkTransaction' (operation a Calypso Secure Session in case a **Hoplink** test card is detected) will be fixed to support the multi-SE feature.
  - Improvements org.eclipse.keyple.seproxyAbstractObservableReader (to provide generic logging of SeRequest/SeResponse) and 
org.eclipse.keyple.seproxy.AbstractLocalReader (to factorize as possible the ApduRequest/ApduResponse processing between plugins of local readers).

- **Week #24**:
  - Update of the Calypso Secured Session (org.eclipse.keyple.calypso.transaction.PoSecureSession) in order to support the new multi-SE request feature.
    - Improvement of the 'KeypleCalypsoDemo_HoplinkTransaction' PC Java example ( [https://github.com/calypsonet/keyple-java/blob/develop/keyple-example/pc/src/main/java/org/eclipse/keyple/examples/pc/KeypleCalypsoDemo_HoplinkTransaction.java](https://github.com/calypsonet/keyple-java/blob/develop/keyple-example/pc/src/main/java/org/eclipse/keyple/examples/pc/KeypleCalypsoDemo_HoplinkTransaction.java) ) ==> in case of Hoplink card detection, operates 3 chained Calypso Secure Session with different settings:
      - first session : initial Hoplink selection & simple two steps secure session, without sendable in session PO commands, asking to keep the logical channel open,
      - second session : Using the same logical channel (no need of Hoplink selection) three steps secured session including several PO read or write commands sendable in session. The physical channel is closed at the end.
      - third session : new Hoplink selection, simple two steps secure session, & close of the physical channel.
  - Improvements of the plugin abstract classes factorizing code for SE reader plugins ==> the amount of code required to implement a proprietary reader plugin is strongly reduced.
- **Week #25**:
    - Improvement of the Code factorization for the implementation  of Reader Plugins ==> now the integration of a new proprietary plugin would require to just define native interfaces wrapping & specific parameters setting.

- July 2018
  - Definition of the Remote SE plugin.

## Documentations & binaries
### Functional specifications:

 - **'Keyple Core module' specification**': [https://calypsonet.github.io/keyple-doc/keyple-core-spec/](https://calypsonet.github.io/keyple-doc/keyple-core-spec/) 
   - ==> since a recent refactoring the text of the chapters ยง2.2 & ยง2.3 has still to be rewritten but all the related UML class diagrams are inline with the current java implementation.
   - **'Keyple Calypso Library specification'**: [https://calypsonet.github.io/keyple-doc/keyple-extension-calypso-spec/](https://calypsonet.github.io/keyple-doc/keyple-extension-calypso-spec/)

For the moment, the JavaDocs of the two Android plugins (NFC reader & OMAPI) aren't yet publicly hosted on github.io ==> it'll be solved in the coming weeks. Pending, developers have the possibility to generate them by themselves from the Keyple-java repository.
