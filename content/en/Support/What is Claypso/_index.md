Calypso is the open standard for secure, fast and flexible public transport ticketing systems deployed all over the world. The standard is accessible freely to all authorities, operators and industrial companies, to ensure: 
-	The birth of this new standard suited to the public transport needs. 
-	A good products compatibility. 
-	A fair market concurrence. 

Even if KEYPLE may hide a lot of complexity of Calypso cryptography, the use of these cards and their file structure requires a minimum understanding of Calypso technology.
